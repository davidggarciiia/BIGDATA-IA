# BIGDATA-IA

Big Data & AI Specialization Course 📊🤖
Welcome to my learning portfolio! 👋 This repository is the result of an intensive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Specialization Course, where I've cultivated the skills to transform data into knowledge. 💡

Here, you will dive into a journey through:

Big Data Technologies: How to manage and process massive data volumes with powerful tools. 🚀

Artificial Intelligence: From the fundamentals to the implementation of complex Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. 🧠

Practical Projects: Real-world use cases where I apply what I've learned to solve real-world problems, using Python and its most advanced libraries. ✨
